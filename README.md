This screen means that a password has been generated in the containerâ€™s /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword file. You need to get that password to enter here. Since, I have mapped the /var/jenkins_home directory in the container with the /User/TriPhan/jenkins directory, I just need to open the /User/TriPhan/jenkins/secrets directory so I can get the password in the initialAdminPassword file to fill.

Open finder -> Select Go -> Select Home... In this here.. you can see folder Jenkins and get password in here.
Jenkins/secrets and open file initialAdminPassword.
